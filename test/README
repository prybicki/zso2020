Each `TEST` is consisted of two binaries: main ELF file `exec_TEST` and `rel_TEST` that has to be applied.
Invoke `./test.sh` to execute all tests.


Available tests:
- syscall - add simple wrapper, no external symbols except `orig_start`
- syscall2 - similar to above, slightly different relocations
- noop - no additional code to be executed
- call - call to function from base ELF
- var - access to global variable in base ELF
- static - simple test compiled with static
- double call - `call` applied twice
- ro - test of proper handling .rodata
- rw - test of proper handling .data
- def - test of proper handling non-initialized variables
