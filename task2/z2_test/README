Avaliable tests:
================
- fstat          Test if fstat() result proper file size.
- ftrunc         Checks if ftruncate() properly handles buffered data.
- lseek          Verify if lseek() takes into account buffered data.
- multi_fd       Two separate descriptors, no modifications written
- multi_fd_sync  Two separate descriptors, write() with fsync()

For each pair (write, read), (pwrite, pread), (writev, readv), (pwritev, preadv), (pwritev2, preadv2):
- default_*    Open `tst` file without O_BUFFERED_WRITE, write sample data, read (verify).
               All changes should be written to file
- nosync_*     Open `tst` file with O_BUFFERED_WRITE, write sample data, read (verify).
               File on disk should remain unchanged.
- sync_*       As above + execute fsync()
- partial_*    Open `tst` file with O_BUFFERED_WRITE, write part of data, fsync, write rest of data and read everyting.
               Only first part of data should be written to file.
